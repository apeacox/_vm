A generic verion manager.

So far, I've generically reimplemented [chruby][1]. The only point of this
experiment is to see whether or not machine generated posix shell is even sane.

Requires [shell-proxy][2] which is so alpha it's not even really published.
Pull it down and stick it in your load path.
